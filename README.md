# Windows Subsystem for Android™ helper

This repo contains an IntelliJ IDEA plugin to launch the Windows Subsystem for
Android™.

*But wait, isn't it launched automatically when I open an Android app on Windows
11?*

Yes, that's right. This plugin is helpful if you want to run your Android app on
the Windows Subsystem for Android™ **from within your IDE**, in order to run 
or debug your Android app.
